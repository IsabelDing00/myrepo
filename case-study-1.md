### Finding the Worst, Highest-Paid NBA Player, Ever
https://pudding.cool/2019/12/real-mvp/

This vedio is for finding the worst, highest-paid NBA player from 2000-2019. Due to the lack of data and some datas are speculative, the author stop finding the palyers before 2000. I think the authosr chose the right graph to show his data. By capturing a player's overall performance (y-axis) based on a very complex equation that accounts for many metrics like playing time, rebounds and so on. Comparing with the salaries (x-axis) those NBA players got, the graph shows who is the worst and highest-paid NBA player in every year clearly (the one in the right bottom of the graph). One thing I like is that the author also shows some players performance and salaries in time-series. But I think he can add the function to show how the selected dot (a specific player) change in different years.

### What Are the Most Popular Discontinued Cars?

This website first shows why is question matter by useing a chart to show the discontinued vehicles cover how much percent of total sales. Another thing I like which is that the graphs later shows the top 10 best-selling discontinued vehicles and pictures of those cars, and top 5 states for discontined car sales. One thing I don't like those data which is too many graphs and too many different information in different graphs so I can't compare cars every easily. 

### The most Solar Places in America

This website contains many graphs.I really like those graphs because those graphs shows the data and easy for audience to find the data the want and easy to make comparison. For example, one is to show the solar data in CA with different color to show the solar panel density, one shows the solar panel popularity by metro area by ranking list. I found one question is that the title is for the most solar places in America but in fact most places in the data are from CA. So I would like to add one more graph to show how the solar distributed in whole US.

### The World through the eyes of the US.
https://pudding.cool/2018/12/countries/

This is a very interesting chart. This chart shows one country on Americans' conscious and how that change. The y-axis shows the year from 1900 to 2018 (from top to bottom), the x-axis shows the month. Every year has one or two countries had been mentioned most. And there are more details of when and why those foreign countries had been mentioned. I like this chart but I also found that some countries' flags didn't change, for example, there is no Soviet flag but Russian. I might use the proper flags and I would like to add some information at the right side of the chart to show that the flags has been changed.
